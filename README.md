## 📄 **README – Devcontainer Upgrade & CI Guide**


---

### 🚀 Development Environment

This project is now **Codespaces-ready** and supports local development in a VS Code **Dev Container** or Docker.

#### **Requirements**

* GitHub Codespaces (recommended)
* OR VS Code with “Remote – Containers” extension + Docker installed locally

---

### 🛠 Features in the Devcontainer

* **Node 20** (LTS)
* **Python 3.11** (for tooling/scripts)
* **Docker-in-Docker** support
* **Preinstalled VS Code extensions**:

  * Prettier
  * ESLint
  * Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
  * GitLens
  * dotenv support
* **Automatic environment setup**:

  * Merges `.env.example` into `.env.local`
  * Injects **Codespaces secrets** automatically
  * Installs dependencies (`pnpm` or `npm`)
  * Installs pre-commit hooks if configured
  * Auto-starts `npm run dev` in Codespaces

---

### 📦 Environment Variables

These keys must be present for full functionality. In **Codespaces**, add them in:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Codespaces → New repository secret**

| Key                                 |
| ----------------------------------- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`                    |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                 |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`                    |
| `PPLX_API_KEY`                      |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`          |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`         |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`                  |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`                 |
| `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`            |

When running locally, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill these in.

---

### 🧪 Continuous Integration (CI)

The repo includes a **GitHub Actions** workflow that runs on every push/PR:

1. **Install dependencies** (`pnpm` if `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists, else `npm ci`)
2. **Lint** (`npm run lint`)
3. **Type-check** (`npm run typecheck`)
4. **Unit tests** (`npm test` if defined)
5. **E2E tests**:

   * If **Playwright** detected → installs browsers and runs `npx playwright test`
   * If **Cypress** detected → installs and runs `npx cypress run` in headless mode

If neither Playwright nor Cypress is found, E2E tests are skipped automatically.

---

### 🖥 Local Dev Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install   # or npm ci

# Copy env variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

---

On your phone, you can paste this into **README.md** in the GitHub web editor so it’s in your repo right away.

---

If you want, I can **merge this README snippet into the `devcontainer-upgrade.zip`** so it’s already included when you unzip it into your repo — that way you don’t have to manually edit on mobile.

Do you want me to rebuild the ZIP with this README.md update included?
